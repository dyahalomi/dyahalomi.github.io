I worked for two years as an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard and Smithsonian (CfA) working with Dr. David Latham. TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is a NASA satellite that launched in April 2018. TESS searches for planets using the transit method. The transit method in exoplanet science is where we look for a periodic decrease in the light received from a distant star, due to the planet passing in front of the star relative to Earth. In working on TESS, I have contributed in several ways to the mission and grown immensely as a researcher.​​
