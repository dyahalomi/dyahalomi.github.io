I've had the opportunity to work in a number of topics in astrophysics. I often say that my journey to exoplanet research started on the largest astrophysical scales and then slowly moved inward to smaller and less energetic phenomonema. I've lead original research in gravitational microlensing of strongly lensed supernova, self-lensing binary star systems in Kepler data and with ground-based radial velocity (RV) Doppler observations, simulating what the search for Solar System analogous planetary architectures will look like with next generation RV and astrometric surveys, and in model selection for exoplanet transit timing variations (TTVs). <br>

For a brief summary of these projects, see below:

## "Killing" the Moon Hypothesis in the Kepler-1513b System
_Advisor: [Prof. David Kipping](http://davidkipping.co.uk/)_ <br>
_Paper: to be posted shortly, accepted in MNRAS (09/2023)_ <br>
_Code: on [GitHub](https://github.com/dyahalomi/Kepler1513)_ <br>

We performed model selection (planet-planet vs. planet-moon vs. stellar activity) on the TTVs observed in Kepler-1513b using follow-up ground-based and space (TESS) observations. We found that the complete TTV signal, including two additional transit observations, a ~decade since the last Kepler observation, was inconsistent with both the planet-moon and the stellar activity hypothesis and was consistent with an external perturbing non-transiting planet near the 5:1 mean motion reference (MMR). <br>

Using nested sampling with [MultiNest](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest), we modeled the TTVs with N-body simulations for the planet-planet model with [SWIFT](https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/swift.html) and a photodynamical planet-moon model with [LUNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3499). We find that the planet-moon model is inconsistent with one the two new transit time observations at the ~3-Ïƒ level. We also show that the observed stellar activity (via stellar rotational period and slope of the LC around transits) is inconsistent with causing the observed TTVs. The main figure from this paper, showing this results, can be seen below. For more details, see the full [paper](LINK) and the [code](https://github.com/dyahalomi/Kepler1513). <br>
