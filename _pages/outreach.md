## Harvard Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP)
I am the Deputy Director of the Harvard-MIT Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP), since 2020. The SRMP is a program in which 12 high school students from the public Cambridge Ridge and Latin School conduct research projects with scientists at the CfA and MIT. I mentored three high school students on a project studying self-lensing binaries from 2020-2021.

​

As the Head of Observing from 2018-2020, I created a program in which I taught the students about lenses, mirrors, and telescopes, and guided them through the construction of galileoscopes. I additionally taught classes in astronomical imaging, instrumentation, and databases at the start of the program, and co-mentor the cohort. My work culminated in an observing night with the SRMP students, using the Clay Telescope and galileoscopes.

​

Through my work with these students, I have become a better scientist as I learn through teaching and am reminded of the passion and deep interest that first brought me to astronomy.​

## Mentorship
I'm passionate about mentorship at all levels of academia. I have multiple strong female mentors who have guided me throughout my studies, and I encourage women -- especially women of colour -- to surround themselves with people that appreciate your value.
