I'm a Flatiron Research Fellow at the Flatiron Institute, Center for Computational Astrophysics. Starting in January 2026, I will be a Torres Fellow at MIT. 

I am a data driven dynamicist, which means that I develop techniques that fuse data analysis with dynamical theory & simulations to study the formation, evolution, and orbital configurations of exoplanetary systems.

I received my PhD from Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2025. I received my bachelor's from MIT in Physics with a Concentration in Astronomy and with Minors in Computer Science and Comparitive Media Studies in 2018. After MIT, I spent two years working as a part of the TESS Science Team at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. While at Columbia, I was a [NASA ExoExplorer](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/exopag/exoexplorers/exoexplorers-welcome/), an [LSSTC Data Science Fellow](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/lincc/fellowship_program), and an [AAS National Osterbrock Leadership Fellow](https://aas.org/nolp).


I am passionate about mentoring younger scientists. I've worked with high school students on astronomy research through the [Harvard SRMP](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/shrimp) since 2018, and I served as Co-Director of the program from 2021-2023. I am currently devloping a similar program at Columbia, that will start in Fall 2024.




## Research Interests

My research focuses on **exoplanets** and the stars that they orbit. An exoplanet (short for extrasolar planet) is any planet outside of our solar system.

I am most interested in projects at the intersection of exoplanet astronomy and data science in the data-limited regime.  A common theme in my work has been fusing dynamical constraints from varied observational techniques in order to study extrasolar planets, particularly in multi-planet systems, with a focus on planetary dynamics and architectures.

I am also the lead developer of the [`democratic detrender`](https://github.com/dyahalomi/democratic_detrender), a Python package for detrending time-series stellar photometry. The code has been extensively tested (>1000 stars) on Kepler and TESS light curves. A formal write-up and tutorial are forthcoming for the code.
