I'm a Flatiron Research Fellow at the Flatiron Institute, Center for Computational Astrophysics. Starting in January 2026, I will be a Torres Fellow at MIT.

My research focuses on **exoplanets** (short for extrasolar planet) and the stars that they orbit. Specifically, I am a **data driven dynamicist**, which means that I develop techniques that fuse data analysis with dynamical theory & simulations to study the evolution, demographics, and orbital configurations of exoplanetary systems.

I received my PhD from Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2025. I received my bachelor's from MIT in Physics with a Concentration in Astronomy and with Minors in Computer Science and Comparitive Media Studies in 2018. After MIT, I spent two years working as a part of the TESS Science Team at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. While at Columbia, I was a [NASA ExoExplorer](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/exopag/exoexplorers/exoexplorers-welcome/), an [LSSTC Data Science Fellow](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/lincc/fellowship_program), and an [AAS National Osterbrock Leadership Fellow](https://aas.org/nolp).


I am passionate about mentoring younger scientists. I've worked with high school students on astronomy research through the [Harvard SRMP](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/shrimp) since 2018, and I served as Co-Director of the program from 2021-2023 and will again starting in 2026. I am the Founding Director (and currently Advisory Director) of the Columbia STAR (Student Training in Astronomy Research) Program, which is now in its 2nd year in 2025-2026.
