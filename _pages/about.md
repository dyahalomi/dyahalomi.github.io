I am a graduate student at Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics. I received my bachelor's from MIT in Physics with a Concentration in Astronomy and with Minors in Computer Science and Comparitive Media Studies in 2018. After MIT, I spent two years working as a part of the TESS Science Team at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I am a [LSSTC DSFP Fellow](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/lincc/fellowship_program) and an [AAS NOLP Fellow](https://aas.org/nolp).


I am passionate about mentoring younger scientists. I have been lucky to be involved with mentoring high school research project through the [Harvard SRMP](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/shrimp) since 2018, and I served as Co-Director of the program from 2021-2023. I am currently trying to develop a similar program at Columbia, with an anticipate start in Fall 2024.



## Research Interests

My research focuses on **exoplanets** and the stars that they orbit. An exoplanet (which is short for extrasolar planet) is any planet outside of our solar system.

I am most interested in projects at the intersection of exoplanet astronomy and data science in the data-limited regime.  A common theme in my work has been fusing dynamical constraints from varied observational techniques in order to study extrasolar planets with a focus on planetary dynamics and architectures.

I am the lead developer of the [`democratic detrender`](https://github.com/dyahalomi/democratic_detrender), a Python package for detrending time-series stellar photometry. The code has been extensively tested (>1000 stars) in Kepler and TESS light curves. A formal write-up and tutorial are forthcoming for the code.
